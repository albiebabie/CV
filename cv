##### About Me
```
Well, I'm basically a walking jukebox, although I'm sad to say I don't do requests.
When I'm not beatboxing, humming or annoying the world; I'm actually
recording my own music and it's this that has led me to an interest in software
and technology.

Following my technological instincts, I enrolled with Makers Academy to explore
the wonderful world of coding. I'm happy to say that I have recently survived
what was a testing 16 weeks, studying core concepts including OOP, TDD and much more.
My fingers are now like well refined gymnasts, they dance out lines of code as
easily as they move around the frets of a guitar.

I'm hungry to continue learning and I hope to find a junior developer role within
a company that is as passionate about teamwork and creativity as I am.

### Skills:

#### Attention to detail
```
I've worked on TV adverts, for companies including confused.com, Cravendale and
Oreo; as a prop maker and set builder it's crucial to have a good eye for detail,
the camera reveals everything - it's important to get things right the first
time round.
```

#### Team Player
```
I've always liked working in teams and as a keen sportsman and musician I have
had lots of opportunity to do so. Most of the work that I do is predominantly
team based and earlier this year I went out to volunteer in Calais. I worked
in a small group building a Youth Centre, with the intention of providing a safe environment for
the young refugees to learn and play.
```

#### Like to learn

```
From my lego building childhood, I've always been interested in making things
and tinkering. I don't shy away from picking up something new: I've taught myself
the guitar, pulled apart and repaired many phones and computers. I'm self-competitive
and always want to improve.
